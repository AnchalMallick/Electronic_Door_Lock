# Electronic_Door_Lock
An electronic door lock designed in TinkerCad

I have designed an electronic locking system in TinkerCad. A 4x4 keypad has been interfaced with Arduino Uno R3 to accept the 6 character password from the user. As the password is entered by the user,each character is displayed on the 2x16 LCD as '*'. After the password has been entered, it is compared with the predefined correct password. If both match, the door opens(motion in servo motor), a welcome message being displayed, followed by a timer to let the user in; otherwise the user is prompted to try again.
The circuit is shown as follows:
